1) How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
First, the scale of the website. Since it is a small site with mainly three pages / components. I did not pick React Router to seperate three pages. Yet, I chose to change the content within the content compoentent.
Second, If it is a larger site, I will also consider Redux to manage the state. Especially if I am asked to also build filter / pagination , I would choose to use redux. I did that in my latest portfolio. You might want to refer to my portfolio. 


2) Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes. The individual description of each movie, like what I have done for my portofolio.

3) What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would use redux and react router.
